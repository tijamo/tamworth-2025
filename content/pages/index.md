      ..and welcome.


      So now that you've found us, we encourage you to have a look around and
      find out more about us.  You can use our [contact form](/contact-us) for
      any questions or anything you would like to say to us.


      We're a friendly bunch of very ordinary non-judgemental people.


      Although we are called Tamworth Christadelphian Church, we have relocated
      to Dordon Village Hall, as we grew too large for our previous space.  We
      would like you to think of us as the Church in the Village Hall, where you
      can feel free to pop in and meet us on any Sunday morning.


      Dordon Village Hall, Browns Lane, Dordon, Tamworth B78 1TL
