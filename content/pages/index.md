      ..and welcome. 




      Although we are called Tamworth Christadelphian Church, we have relocated
      to Dordon Village Hall, as we grew too large for our previous space.  We
      would like you to think of us as the Church in the Village Hall, where you
      can feel free to pop in and meet us on any Sunday morning.
