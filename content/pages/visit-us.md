    text: "You can expect a warm friendly welcome from our members if you decide to join us on a Sunday morning.\n\nOur Sunday service starts at about 11.00 am and usually finishes by 12.30pm. From 10.30am,\_ we serve tea, coffee, juice and biscuits (there might be some cake if you’re really lucky). This is a great opportunity to say hello and get to know us a bit better. We would love to meet you!\n\n## FAQs\n\n### What are your Sunday services like?\n\nWe aim to make our worship services as accessible as possible. Our services include prayers, Bible readings, and a mix of contemporary spiritual songs and traditional hymns. There is always an encouraging talk on a variety of themes related to the Bible.  Sometimes we use video clips and other activities to explore our theme that day.\n\nEvery week we share bread and wine together to celebrate and remember Jesus’s death and resurrection.\n\n### What should I wear?\n\nThere is no dress code. People at our church wear what is comfortable for them, such as jeans and t-shirt, suit and tie, or anything in between. So please come as you feel comfortable.\n\n### Is there something suitable for children?\n\nYes. We worship God together as a family, and the children join in each week. Sunday School runs from 9.15am to 10.15am on Sundays in term time, and we hear about their lesson as part of the service.\_ We believe it’s important that children feel part of the church - they are the future, after all!\n\nSometimes our services are led by a family and therefore involve the children more directly.\n\nWe encourage children to bring things with them. We usually have a table with lego, floor mats, tabletop games and crafts, for children to use.\_ Some bring a book to read or choose to listen to the service. Don’t worry, we’re used to noise and little ones wandering about.\n\n### Where do I park?\n\nThe hall has\_a good sized car park.\_ If it’s full, there is plenty of street parking.\_ Please remember to park respectfully and not on the grass verges.\n\n### Will I be expected to make a donation?\n\nThere is a collection during each service when people are invited to contribute to the cost of the church’s work and other charities, but this is completely voluntary.\n\n### Accessibility\n\nWe aim to be an all-inclusive church. The building\_ has a ramp to the entrance and accessible toilets.\_\n\n### I have a question not listed here\n\nIf you have any other questions, please email us or send us a message on Facebook. Alternatively, just pop in and say hello. You don’t have to stay for the service.\n"
