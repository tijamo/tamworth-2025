    text: "We are part of the world wide Christian church, and we share many beliefs and practices with other Christians around the world.\n\nThe church is not so much a particular place or building, but rather a family of believers, committed to Christ, to one another and to the service of God in the world.\n\nWe put a great emphasis on family in our church.\_ We are here to support and encourage each other in many different situations. \nIn this family everybody is equal; everybody has a part to play in the service of God. There is no hierarchy; each takes their place according to their gifts and calling.\n\nThis could be in teaching or preaching, caring or serving, praying or administration. Each and every one is encouraged to find out what their role is in the church.\n\nAll decisions are made by all members of the church.\nWe don’t have any paid members; anyone can preach and teach.\_ Everyone who teaches in Sunday School is DBS checked and we have a dedicated safeguarding team.\t\n\nWe are a registered charity\n\n\n\n\nWe are part of the worldwide Christadelphian community.\n\nBeing a Christadelphian is just one of many ways of being a Christian. Jesus is clear that there is only one way for us to receive the eternal life so freely offered by God, and that is by trusting in Jesus Christ who is the Way, the Truth and the Life. (John chapter 14 verse 6)\n\nWe are encouraged to share our faith with others, but we would never be dogmatic, or insistent that visitors agree with us.\_ We will happily discuss and are interested to hear your views.\_\n\n\n\n\nOUR CORE BELIEFS\n\nWe believe that ….\n\n·\_ \tGod is the creator of all things.\_ He is ever present and all powerful\n \_ \_ \t\n\n·\_ \tJesus is the son of God.\_ Mary was chosen by God to be Jesus’s mother.\_ Jesus’s father is divine; his mother, human.\_ He therefore is Son of God and Son of Man.\n\n\n\n\n·\_ \tas Son of Man, Jesus was mortal and prone to sin as we all are.\_ Instead, he always chose God’s way and remained sinless.\n\_\_\n\n·\_ \tthe Holy Spirit is God’s power, through which he works\n\n\n\n\n·\_ \tthe Bible is the inspired word of God.\_ From its pages we learn about Jesus Christ and how he wants us to live as his disciples.\n\n\n\n\n·\_ \tbaptism (full immersion in water) symbolises an person’s desire to die to self and rise to a new life, living for Christ.\_ To be able to say “I believe Jesus is Lord” requires understanding.\_ Baptism is for those who desire to make this confession for themselves.\n\n\n\n\n·\_ \tfreedom of thought is encouraged. A free faith, is a truth faith, lived through conviction and dedication to declaring the truth of the Bible.\n\n\n\n\n·\_ \twe are mortal – when we die we will cease to exist\n\n\n\n\n·\_ \twe are sinful – we naturally do things that don’t please God, but despite our sinful nature, God has given us a way to be forgiven, to be part of His plan, and to live with Him forever\n\n\n\n\n·\_ \tJesus is the way that\_ – through his sinless life, death and resurrection - we can be saved\n\n\n\n\n·\_ \tsince Jesus’ death and resurrection, he has been living and working with God in heaven\n\n\n\n\n·\_ \tJesus will return to set up God’s Kingdom which will fill the whole earth\n\n\n\n\n·\_ \tin the Kingdom of God there will be no more death, and the world will be filled with God’s glory!\n\nWhy Be Baptised?\n\nJesus Christ commands his followers to be baptised. He instructed his disciples to, ‘go and make disciples of all nations, baptising them in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. (Matthew chapter 28 verse 19).\n\n Baptism is a vital step on the journey of faith because in it:\n\n· \_ \twe follow the example of Jesus, who was baptised by John the Baptist because, ‘it is right to do all that God requires’ (Matthew chapter 3 verse 15).\n\n\n\n\n· \_ \twe continue the practice of the first Christians who baptised all who responded to the preaching of the gospel (see Acts chapter 2 verses 37-41)\n\n\n\n\n· \_ \tbaptism symbolises our participation in the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ and in it we testify that our lives are now under his authority (see Romans chapter 6 verses 1-11).\n\n\n\n\nIn this act we declare our faith in Christ and our commitment to live a new life in his Holy Spirit.\n\n\n\n\nBreaking Bread together ...\n\nThe simple act of sharing bread and wine together is central to most Christian churches and is called communion.\n\nFor us this serves as the focal point of our service each Sunday. As we pray and worship together, we remember how our Lord Jesus Christ gave his life for each and every one of us.\_\_\n\nThe bread reminds us that Jesus gave his body on the cross for our sakes. We remember how Jesus said, “This is my body, which is broken for you.” when he shared the last supper with his disciples.\n\nAfter we have eaten some bread, we take a sip of wine, just as Jesus and his friends did. We remember how he said, “This cup is the New Covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you.” It reminds us that Jesus gave his life for our sake: his blood was the cost of our forgiveness.\n\n\n"
